This project addresses the Kaggle competition "Natural Language Processing with Disaster Tweets," which challenges participants to develop models capable of distinguishing between tweets that describe actual disasters and those that use disaster terminology metaphorically or in non-emergency contexts. The binary classification task requires assigning a label of 1 (disaster) or 0 (non-disaster) to each tweet.

Tweets present unique challenges for natural language processing due to their brevity, informal structure, and heavy reliance on contextual cues. Classification difficulty is compounded by the frequent metaphorical use of disaster-related language in social media (e.g., "my social life is a disaster" or "that concert was fire"), requiring models to interpret nuanced language patterns rather than relying solely on keyword presence. This task therefore provides a useful setting for evaluating whether sequence-based models that capture word order and context offer measurable advantages over traditional bag-of-words approaches.
